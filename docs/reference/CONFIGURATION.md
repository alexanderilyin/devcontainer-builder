# Configuration

Every field resolves through the same precedence: **CLI flag > environment
variable > settings file > default**. This is purely additive — with no
settings file configured (the common case), every field resolves exactly
as it did before the settings file existed. Config loading
(`service/src/config.ts`'s `loadServiceConfig`) runs at process startup,
before `server.listen()` — any misconfiguration here crashes the process
immediately rather than surfacing as a mysterious per-request failure
later (see [0005](../decisions/0005-bdd-suite-on-thomas.md)'s sibling
concern documented in
[Architecture](../concepts/architecture.md#startup-and-shutdown)).

## Fields

| Field | CLI flag | Env var | Settings file path | Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BuildKit endpoint | `--buildkit-endpoint` | `BUILDKIT_ENDPOINT` | `buildkit.endpoint` | *(unset — readiness fails)* |
| HTTP port | `--port` | `PORT` | `service.port` | `8080` |
| Buildx builder name | `--buildx-builder-name` | `BUILDX_BUILDER_NAME` | *(none)* | `devcontainer-builder-remote` |
| SSH host key policy | `--ssh-host-key-policy` | `SSH_HOST_KEY_POLICY` | `sshHostKeyPolicy` | `tofu` |
| Git credentials file path | `--git-credentials-config-path` | `GIT_CREDENTIALS_CONFIG_PATH` | *(none — see below)* | *(unset — empty list)* |
| Registry mapping file path | `--registry-mapping-config-path` | `REGISTRY_MAPPING_CONFIG_PATH` | *(none — see below)* | *(unset — empty list)* |
| Settings file path itself | `--settings` | `SERVICE_CONFIG_PATH` | — | *(unset)* |

`gitCredentials`/`registryMapping` have no CLI flag or env var of their
own for the *entries themselves* (only a *path* to a file, for both the
dedicated-file and settings-file forms) — there's no practical way to
express a structured list as a single flag or env var value.

## The settings file

One JSON or YAML file (`SERVICE_CONFIG_PATH`/`--settings`), parsed by
extension (`.json`, `.yaml`, or `.yml` — anything else is a startup
error). Its shape deliberately mirrors the Helm chart's own
[`values.yaml`](HELM.md) keys and nesting, not a flat, invented shape —
an operator who already knows the chart's values recognizes this file
immediately:

```json
{
  "buildkit": { "endpoint": "tcp://buildkit.example:1234" },
  "service": { "port": 8080 },
  "sshHostKeyPolicy": "pinned",
  "gitCredentials": {
    "entries": [
      { "host": "github.com", "kind": "https", "username": "svc-bot", "token": "ghp_example" },
      { "host": "gitlab.internal.example.com", "kind": "ssh", "privateKey": "-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\n...", "pinnedHostKey": "gitlab.internal.example.com ssh-ed25519 AAAA..." }
    ]
  },
  "registryMapping": {
    "rules": [
      { "hostMatch": "github.com", "pathPrefix": "org-a/", "registry": "ghcr.io/org-a" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Every other key `values.yaml` has (`image`, `resources`,
`registryAuth`, ...) has no runtime-config meaning here and is silently
ignored if present — this file only ever feeds `loadServiceConfig`, it's
never re-templated back into the chart.

!!! warning "A malformed or non-object settings file crashes at startup"
    Invalid JSON/YAML, a file that parses to something other than an
    object, or a wrong-typed known field (`buildkit.endpoint` not a
    string, `service.port` not a number, `gitCredentials`/
    `registryMapping` not an object, `.entries`/`.rules` not an array)
    all throw synchronously at startup — the same "fail loud, fail
    immediately" behavior as every other config source, not a silently
    ignored or partially-applied file.

## `gitCredentials.entries` / `registryMapping.rules`

Same array shape whether they arrive via the settings file
(`gitCredentials.entries`/`registryMapping.rules`) or a dedicated file
(`GIT_CREDENTIALS_CONFIG_PATH`/`REGISTRY_MAPPING_CONFIG_PATH` — a bare
JSON/YAML array, not wrapped in an object). A **dedicated-file path, if
set, wins entirely over the settings file's own entries for that same
list** — they don't merge.

### Git credential entry

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `host` | `string` | Required, non-empty. Matched exactly against the clone URL's host. |
| `kind` | `"https"` \| `"ssh"` | Required. |
| `username`, `token` | `string` | Required if `kind: "https"`. |
| `privateKey` | `string` | Required, non-empty, if `kind: "ssh"`. |
| `pinnedHostKey` | `string` | Optional for `kind: "ssh"` — required if `sshHostKeyPolicy: "pinned"`. |

### Registry mapping rule

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `hostMatch` | `string` | Optional. Exact match against the clone URL's host. |
| `pathPrefix` | `string` | Optional. Prefix match against the clone URL's path. |
| `registry` | `string` | Required, non-empty. |

Rules are checked in order; the first rule whose `hostMatch` (if given)
and `pathPrefix` (if given) both match wins. A rule with neither field
set is a universal fallback. See
[0003: Registry resolution via mapping rules](../decisions/0003-registry-resolution-via-mapping-rules.md).

!!! note "One bad entry is skipped and logged, not fatal"
    Inside an otherwise-valid array, one entry that fails its own shape
    check (missing `host`, wrong `kind`, etc.) is logged
    (`skipping invalid <git credentials|registry mapping> config entry
    at index <n>`) and dropped — the service still starts, using every
    *other* valid entry. This is different from the array/settings
    *file itself* being malformed (see the warning above), which is
    fatal. The array-vs-file distinction exists because a single typo'd
    entry shouldn't take down every other configured host, but a
    genuinely broken config file should never be silently treated as
    "no config."

## `SSH_HOST_KEY_POLICY`

`tofu` (default) or `pinned` — any other value is a startup error
(`SSH_HOST_KEY_POLICY must be "tofu" or "pinned", got "<value>"`). See
[Credential handling](../concepts/credential-handling.md#ssh-a-scratch-key-known_hosts-gated-by-host-key-policy)
for what each policy actually does at clone time.
