Feature: Service startup configuration loading
  As an operator deploying devcontainer-builder
  I want misconfiguration caught at startup rather than surfacing as mysterious per-request failures
  So that a bad deployment fails its readiness/liveness checks immediately instead of serving broken requests

  Runs the real service as a Kubernetes Deployment via its own Helm chart.
  A misconfiguration that crashes the process before it ever calls
  server.listen() means the pod can never pass its readiness probe - so
  rather than a doomed `--wait` that sits out its full timeout, every
  crash-loop scenario here installs without `--wait`, waits for the real
  Pod to become discoverable, then polls its own logs for the exact
  fatal-startup log line (same shape as every other log-based assertion
  already used throughout this migration - a container repeatedly
  crashing on a fatal startup error still deterministically re-produces
  the same log line on every attempt).

  Background:
    Given the value of environment variable "CODER_WORKSPACE_OWNER_NAME", or "USER", or "local" is known as "<Owner>"
    And the value of environment variable "CUCUMBER_WORKER_ID" or "0" is known as "<WorkerId>"
    And the value "devcontainer-builder-<Owner>-w<WorkerId>" is known as "<Namespace>"

    Given Directory "<NamespaceChartDir>" at "../charts/test-namespace"

      | --set     | targetNamespace=<Namespace> |
    Then the command exited with 0

    Given Docker Buildx Builder known as "<Builder>":
      | PROPERTY | VALUE                                                            |
