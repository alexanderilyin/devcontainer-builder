<title>Decision log</title>

# Decision log

Architecture Decision Records — each one captures a single real design
decision, the context that led to it, and its honest trade-offs, so
nobody has to reconstruct "why did we do it this way?" from git blame
later. See [adr.github.io](https://adr.github.io/) for the convention
this follows. Numbers are sequential and never reused, even for a
rejected or superseded decision — a reference to "ADR-0003" always
points at the same file.

This is a different kind of document from
[`docs/claude/plans/`](https://github.com/alexanderilyin/devcontainer-builder/tree/main/docs/claude/plans):
a plan is written *before* a change lands, to think through how to make
it; an ADR is a durable record of a decision *already made*, kept
accurate after the fact (superseded by a new ADR when circumstances
change, never rewritten in place).
