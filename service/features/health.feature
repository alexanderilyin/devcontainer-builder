Feature: Liveness, readiness, and unknown routes
  As the Kubernetes Deployment running devcontainer-builder
  I want distinct liveness and readiness signals
  So that traffic is only routed to a pod that can actually accept a build

  Runs the real service as a Kubernetes Deployment via its own Helm chart,
  not a local process - each scenario needs a differently-configured pod,
  so the per-scenario `helm upgrade --install` lives in each Scenario, not
  the Background (only the namespace/image setup common to all of them
  does). Two of the four @server-config scenarios (the ones that leave
  buildkit.endpoint unset) deliberately produce a pod that will never pass
  its own readiness probe: those use `updateStrategy.type=Recreate` and
  skip --wait (it would time out waiting for a Ready state that never
  comes), then talk to the pod's own IP directly via a real HTTP Endpoint
  on a Pod, since a ClusterIP Service never routes to a not-Ready pod at
  all.

  Background:
    # A real ${CODER_WORKSPACE_OWNER_NAME:-${USER:-local}} fallback -
    # avoids collisions between different developers sharing this cluster.
    Given the value of environment variable "CODER_WORKSPACE_OWNER_NAME", or "USER", or "local" is known as "<Owner>"
    And the value of environment variable "CUCUMBER_WORKER_ID" or "0" is known as "<WorkerId>"
    And the value "devcontainer-builder-<Owner>-w<WorkerId>" is known as "<Namespace>"

    Given Directory "<NamespaceChartDir>" at "../charts/test-namespace"

    Then the command exited with 0

    # Build and push this run's own real devcontainer-builder image - the
    # service's own real source, not a stand-in fixture - using the

    # (ambient `docker login`, not threaded through Gherkin/Thomas at all).
    Given Docker Buildx Builder known as "<Builder>":
