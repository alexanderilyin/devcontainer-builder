Feature: Image name, tag, and registry resolution
  As a caller of devcontainer-builder
  I want sensible defaults for the pushed image reference
  So that I don't have to compute a registry, name, or tag myself for every build

  Runs real builds against a real git server and the anonymous test
  registry. Almost every scenario needs its own registryMapping.rules, so -
  unlike every other migrated file so far - the devcontainer-builder Helm
  Release itself is NOT in the Background; only the fixtures every
  scenario shares (test-registry, test-registry-authed, test-buildkit,
  test-git-server, this repo's own service image) are. gitCredentials
  stays disabled throughout (this file never needs git auth), so only
  registryMapping varies per scenario.

  A resolved image's exact sha suffix is a real, content-derived value
  this suite can't dictate (it depends on the seed commit's real
  timestamp) - rather than independently re-deriving it via a second git
  query (the old suite's `git ls-remote ... | cut -c1-7`), scenarios that
  need one compare a *prefix* (registry/name:sha-) via `contains`, which is
  exactly as precise for what's actually under test here (did resolution
  pick the right registry/name and correctly default to a sha-tag) without
  a second, independent fixture round-trip. Scenarios with a fully literal
  expected tag (no sha involved) compare with `equals` instead. Both use
  the new `the value known as ... {condition} ...` comparison (see
  docs/reference/REST.md) to compare the response's real resolved image
  against an expected value composed from <RegistryUrl>/<AuthedRegistryUrl>
  (namespace-dependent, so not writable as a fixed literal).
