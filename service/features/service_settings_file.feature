Feature: The chart-rendered settings file
  As an operator deploying devcontainer-builder
  I want the chart to render its own settings file from real values
  So that I never hand-author or escape a JSON/YAML blob myself

  Distinct from service_startup_configuration.feature's other scenarios,
  which exercise individual env vars and the two dedicated
  GIT_CREDENTIALS_CONFIG_PATH/REGISTRY_MAPPING_CONFIG_PATH files - this
  file is about the general SERVICE_CONFIG_PATH settings file itself:
  that the chart renders it automatically from buildkit.endpoint/
  sshHostKeyPolicy/registryMapping.rules (no settingsFile.* value exists
  any more - see charts/devcontainer-builder/templates/_helpers.tpl's
  settingsJson helper), and that config.ts's own parser/validator still
  fails loudly on malformed content, now reached through the chart's
  generic extraVolumes/extraVolumeMounts/extraEnv escape hatches rather
  than a dedicated value (gitCredentials is deliberately never part of
  the chart-rendered settings file - GIT_CREDENTIALS_CONFIG_PATH always
  wins over it - so the malformed-git-credentials-entry scenario below is
  the one negative case that has to inject its own settings file with
  gitCredentials.enabled=false, to actually exercise that embedded-list
  validation path in config.ts rather than the dedicated one).

  Background:
    Given the value of environment variable "CODER_WORKSPACE_OWNER_NAME", or "USER", or "local" is known as "<Owner>"
    And the value of environment variable "CUCUMBER_WORKER_ID" or "0" is known as "<WorkerId>"
    And the value "devcontainer-builder-<Owner>-w<WorkerId>" is known as "<Namespace>"

    Given Directory "<NamespaceChartDir>" at "../charts/test-namespace"
    And Helm Chart "<NamespaceChart>" in "<NamespaceChartDir>"
    And Helm Release known as "<NamespaceRelease>":

      | --set     | targetNamespace=<Namespace> |
    Then the command exited with 0

    Given Docker Buildx Builder known as "<Builder>":
      | PROPERTY | VALUE                                                            |

    When I create Docker Buildx Builder known as "<Builder>"
    Then the command exited with 0
    When I build and push "ghcr.io/alexanderilyin/devcontainer-builder-test:test" from "." using Docker Buildx Builder known as "<Builder>" with:

    Then the command exited with 0

  Scenario: One malformed entry in a settings file's embedded git credentials list is skipped, not fatal
    # Mirrors "One malformed entry in an otherwise-valid git credentials
    # list is skipped, not fatal" in service_startup_configuration.feature
    # for the dedicated GIT_CREDENTIALS_CONFIG_PATH file - same real
    # validation code path (config.ts's validateEntries), reached from a
    # settings file instead. gitCredentials.enabled=false is required here
    # (unlike the positive scenario above) - GIT_CREDENTIALS_CONFIG_PATH
    # always wins over a settings file's own gitCredentials, so it must be
    # unset for this settings file's embedded list to actually be read at
    # all.
