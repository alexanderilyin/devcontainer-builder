Feature: Git source resolution - URL parsing, credential precedence, and protocol conversion
  As an operator of devcontainer-builder
  I want the service to resolve the right credential and clone protocol for a repository
  So that callers don't need to know or care whether a host is configured for HTTPS or SSH

  Runs against a real git server throughout - it genuinely serves all four
  protocols - git://, http://, https:// (real TLS via a self-signed CA
  generated per scenario), and ssh:// (a real authorized key, via a
  `command=` forced wrapper) - so most scenarios below prove an actual,
  working clone rather than inferring success from a specific failure
  signature. One deliberate limit remains, a real infrastructure constraint
  rather than a gap in the service's own logic: "credential resolution is
  correctly scoped per host" is provable as "requests to different hosts
  produce different, correct outcomes" (not accidentally cross-wired) - the
  netrc/SSH key *content* actually used per request is an internal detail
  with no other external signal once the process exits.

  Every scenario needs a differently-configured devcontainer-builder pod
  (server git credentials, SSH_HOST_KEY_POLICY, GIT_SSL_CAINFO), so - same
  shape as image_resolution.feature/registry_auth.feature - its Helm
  Release lives per Scenario, not Background. Unlike every other Helm value
  in this migration so far, `gitCredentials.entries`/`extraEnv`/
  `extraVolumes`/`extraVolumeMounts` are all *arrays* - Helm's own
  array-index `--set`/`--set-file` syntax (`gitCredentials.entries[0].host=...`,
  confirmed directly by rendering and decoding the chart's own generated
  Secret) handles every one of them through the same plain OPTION|VALUE
  table this migration already uses everywhere else, so no values-file
  detour is needed even for these.
