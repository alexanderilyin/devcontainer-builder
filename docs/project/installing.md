# Installing

## Prerequisites

Opening this repo in the provided
[`.devcontainer/`](https://github.com/alexanderilyin/devcontainer-builder/tree/main/.devcontainer)
(VS Code Dev Containers, or any Dev Container-compatible tool) gets you
everything below for free — its `postCreateCommand.sh` installs Helm,
Terraform, the GitHub CLI, `kubectl`, the Docker CLI + `buildx` plugin,
and the `@devcontainers/cli`, on top of the base
`mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/typescript-node:1-20-bookworm` image
(Node 20 already included). Versions are deliberately unpinned there,
matching CI's own unpinned `setup-helm`/`setup-terraform` actions.

Outside a Dev Container, you need real, working installs of: Node 20,
Docker CLI with the `buildx` plugin, `@devcontainers/cli`, and `git` —
the same set `service/Dockerfile` installs into the deployable image
itself.

## The service

```bash
cd service
npm install
npm run build      # tsc -> dist/
npm run start       # node dist/index.js - needs BUILDKIT_ENDPOINT
```

`npm run start` runs the real, compiled entrypoint — it needs a real
`BUILDKIT_ENDPOINT` pointed at a reachable BuildKit daemon before
`/health/ready` reports ready, and a real git host to clone from before
`/build` can do anything. See [Configuration](../reference/CONFIGURATION.md)
for every other source it reads at startup.

### The container image

```bash
docker build -t devcontainer-builder service/
```

Builds the exact multi-stage image the Helm chart deploys — `tsc`
compiles `service/src/` into `dist/` in a build stage, then a slim
runtime stage installs `git`, the Docker CLI + `buildx` plugin (no
`dockerd` — see
[0001](../decisions/0001-remote-buildkit-builder.md)), and
`@devcontainers/cli`, and runs as a non-root `builder` user.

## The Helm chart

```bash
helm lint charts/devcontainer-builder
helm template charts/devcontainer-builder -f my-values.yaml
```

See the [Helm chart reference](../reference/HELM.md) for every value.

## The Terraform module

```bash
cd terraform/devcontainer-build
terraform init
terraform fmt -check -diff
terraform validate
terraform test    # offline only - see the reference page's note on data "http"
```

See the [Terraform module reference](../reference/TERRAFORM.md).

!!! note "Node/npm availability isn't guaranteed in every environment"
    If `npm`/`node` aren't on `PATH`, don't assume the TypeScript
    compiles — verify it or ask, rather than reporting success on faith.

## This documentation site

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv-docs && . .venv-docs/bin/activate
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
mkdocs serve            # live preview at http://127.0.0.1:8000
mkdocs build --strict   # what CI should run on every docs/** change
```

`--strict` is what actually catches a broken internal link or a heading
renamed without updating what links into it — run it after any edit
that touches a link or a heading, not just once at the end.

!!! note "`docs/claude/` is deliberately excluded from this site's nav"
    `docs/claude/plans/` and `docs/claude/notes/` are internal
    planning/investigation records, not part of the published site —
    `mkdocs build` reports them as "exists but not in nav" (an `INFO`,
    not a failure); that's intentional, not an oversight. See the
    [Decision log](../decisions/index.md) for how those differ from a
    real ADR.
