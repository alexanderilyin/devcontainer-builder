Feature: POST /build request shape validation
  As a caller of the devcontainer-builder API
  I want a clear 400 for a malformed request
  So that I can distinguish "my request was wrong" from "the build failed"

  This feature only covers the up-front shape check performed before any
  clone/build work starts (server.ts's isValidBuildRequest). It does not
  cover whether the *values* given are usable (unparseable git URLs,
  unresolvable registries, etc.) - see git_source_resolution.feature and
  image_resolution.feature for that. Scenarios documenting that a request
  "passes validation" deliberately use a nonexistent local file:// path as
  the repository, so the real clone attempt that follows fails fast and
  deterministically with no network dependency - src/server.ts's own
  catch-all turns any such downstream failure into a real 500, so "the
  response status is 500" here is real, direct proof shape validation let
  the request through, not a workaround for a missing assertion.

  Every scenario shares the exact same server configuration (unlike
  health.feature, where server config itself is what varies) - the Helm
  bring-up lives in the Background, which Cucumber reruns fresh (with a
  fresh World) before every scenario, and every scenario tears its own
  Release/Builder back down at its own end - there is no "run once for the
  whole file" construct in Gherkin.

  Background:
    Given the value of environment variable "CODER_WORKSPACE_OWNER_NAME", or "USER", or "local" is known as "<Owner>"
