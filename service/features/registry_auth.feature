Feature: Registry push authentication
  As a caller of devcontainer-builder
  I want to optionally supply my own registry push credentials
  So that I'm not limited to whatever the service's ambient registry auth covers

  Runs against two real registry fixtures: an anonymous one that accepts any
  push, and one that enforces HTTP basic auth (htpasswd) - only the latter
  can actually distinguish "right credentials" from "wrong/no credentials",
  which is what most of these scenarios are really testing. Same fixture
  shape as image_resolution.feature (its own test-registry +
  test-registry-authed + trust-configured test-buildkit + anonymous
  test-git-server); the devcontainer-builder Release again lives per
  Scenario, not Background, since "ambient registry auth" varies.

  "ambient registry auth not configured" is the chart's own default
  (registryAuth.registries defaults to an empty list, rendering
  {"auths":{}}), so most scenarios need no special config beyond the
  shared image/buildkit setup. Only the "correct ambient auth" scenario
  needs real ambient credentials - the same fixed "svc-bot"/"hunter2"
  test-registry-authed itself is configured with in Background, set
  directly as registryAuth.registries[0].username/password - the chart
  builds the real dockerconfigjson itself, no hand-built/pre-base64'd
  value needed.

  Scenario: A registry-credentialed build against one registry and a plain build against another both succeed back to back

    # the ambient/buildx state that a later, differently-targeted request
    # relies on. Only observable from outside as "both requests still
    # work" - internal buildx builder reuse isn't visible over HTTP.
