Feature: devcontainer.json content validity, once it's been found
  As an operator of devcontainer-builder
  I want a build to fail clearly when a devcontainer.json is discoverable but unusable
  So that "found the file" and "could actually build from it" aren't confused

  Distinct from devcontainer_config_discovery.feature, which is only about
  *where* the file lives - every repo here has its devcontainer.json at the
  plain root location, found without ambiguity. What's under test is
  whether its *content* is enough to build anything, including the
  alternate "build": {"dockerfile": ...} shape (every other fixture repo in
  this suite uses a plain "image" reference instead - a materially
  different real path through the devcontainer CLI and BuildKit). Same
  fixture shape as devcontainer_config_discovery.feature (its own dedicated
  trust-configured test-buildkit + disposable test-registry, anonymous
  git:// only) - see that file's own header comment for why that's safe
  here (nothing built against test-registry is ever pulled by kubelet).
