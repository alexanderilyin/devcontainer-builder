Feature: devcontainer.json discovery after clone
  As an operator of devcontainer-builder
  I want the service to find devcontainer.json wherever the containers.dev spec allows it to live
  So that callers aren't forced into one specific repo layout

  See https://containers.dev/implementors/spec/#devcontainerjson - it
  recognizes three locations, in precedence order: .devcontainer/
  devcontainer.json, .devcontainer.json, and .devcontainer/<folder>/
  devcontainer.json (one sub-folder deep, <folder>'s name unspecified).
  test-git-server seeds one real repo per location (see
  charts/test-git-server/values.yaml's devcontainer-json-* entries) - these
  are real builds, so "success" means the devcontainer CLI actually found
  and used the config, not an inferred signal. Every seed repo in this
  feature shares byte-identical devcontainer.json content - only its
  location differs - so the resulting image reference carries no
  information this feature cares about; a 200 alone is already the full,
  direct proof discovery found and used the config (image *content*
  correctness is image_resolution.feature's own, separate concern).

  This deploys its own dedicated, trust-configured BuildKit instance
  (test-buildkit) and its own disposable in-cluster registry
  (test-registry) - unlike health.feature/request_validation.feature's
  Background, which only builds+pushes devcontainer-builder's own service
  image (to real GHCR, via the shared production BuildKit). The two never
  overlap: the shared production BuildKit only ever builds this repo's own
  known-good source; test-buildkit is what the *deployed service* uses at
  runtime to build the fixture repos below, so its trust config (an
  insecure-registry allowance for test-registry) never needs to extend
  past a registry this suite itself throws away afterwards - no node-level
  containerd trust is ever involved, since nothing here is ever pulled by
  kubelet (see /home/coder/rts-terraform/REGISTRY.md for why that would
  matter for a *pulled* image, e.g. this service's own).

  Scenario Outline: A devcontainer.json in a sub-folder is not found automatically - a known gap, not this service's own logic
    # The spec itself only says a sub-folder config MAY exist - it
    # deliberately leaves <folder>'s name unspecified, since a tool can't
    # know which of possibly several sub-folder configs to pick without
    # being told explicitly (the spec: "consider providing a mechanism for
    # users to select one when appropriate"). The devcontainer CLI reflects
    # exactly that: it auto-discovers only the root and standard
    # .devcontainer/devcontainer.json locations - a sub-folder config needs
    # an explicit --config <path>, which build.ts does not currently pass
    # (the /build request has no field for it). Three sub-folder names
    # prove this fails the same way regardless of which folder name is
    # used - it's not a naming mismatch, the location itself isn't checked.
    # The real "not found" text only ever reaches the pod's own stdout
    # (build.ts's run() uses stdio: "inherit"), never the HTTP response
    # body (which only ever gets "... exited with code 1") - so this needs
    # a real log check, not just a status/body assertion.
