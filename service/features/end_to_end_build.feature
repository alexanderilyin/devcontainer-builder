Feature: End-to-end build scenarios
  As a maintainer of devcontainer-builder
  I want a small set of full request/response round trips covering several axes at once
  So that a regression touching more than one area is caught by a single scenario

  These complement the narrowly-scoped scenarios in the other feature
  files; they intentionally combine several resolution axes in one
  request rather than isolating a single one. "Ambient registry auth not
  configured" is the chart's own default (`registryAuth.registries`
  defaults to an empty list, rendering `{"auths":{}}`), so scenarios that
  want that need no extra config. A resolved image's exact sha suffix is
  real and content-derived (see the other migrated files' own header
  comments for why this suite compares a `<registry>/<name>:sha-`
  *prefix* via
  `contains` rather than independently re-deriving the exact sha) - the
  one exception is the "non-default branch" scenario below, where the
  exact sha is genuinely the point; proving that without a second,
  independent git query uses a different, more direct proof (see that
  scenario's own comment).

  Scenario: A non-default branch is actually checked out, not silently ignored
    # Old approach (independently fetching "release"'s own real sha via
    # git ls-remote to compare against) would have needed a new, narrowly-
    # scoped "discover a real git ref" Thomas capability for exactly one
    # scenario in this whole migration - not obviously worth it. A more
    # direct, self-contained proof needs no second git round trip at all:
    # build the SAME repo twice, once on each branch, and assert the two
    # real resolved image tags differ. Since both branches share
    # byte-identical devcontainer.json content (see charts/test-git-server/
    # values.yaml's extraBranches comment) and the only per-build-varying
    # part of the tag is the real, content-derived sha, two DIFFERENT
    # real tags is already direct, sufficient proof `branch` was honored -
    # if it were silently ignored (always building "main"), both requests
    # would resolve to the exact same real tag.
